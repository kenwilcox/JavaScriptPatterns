# JavaScriptPatterns
Just trying out some JavaScript patterns

##Reasoning
There are a lot of examples that I've found on the web. Some have - what I think is - too much noise around the example.

I've tried to just have the bare minimum to make the idea work, and that's all

##Patterns
 - [iffe](/iife) - Immediately-Invoked Function Expression
 - [namespace](/namespace) - Namespace - or module
 - [Prototype](/yoda) - Extending prototype - "".toYoda();
